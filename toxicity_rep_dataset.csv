The use of the n-word and offensive language towards Muslims makes this identity-based negativity. This is also clearly threatening because it refers to acts of sexual violence, as well as contains dehumanizing language about Obama and Muslims that is similar to language used to historically incite violence. Given all of that, this is very toxic and would make me leave the conversation.",2,B

There is not enough context about the broader conversation where this comment was posted, but one has to wonder whether selectively quoting statistics that reinforce a stereotype is appropriate rhetoric (e.g. how does this 3000% number compare to the danger men pose to one another without race as a factor?) and thus comes across as more inflammatory. 3) Using the phrase ""black males"" instead of ""black men"" is dehumanizing as it describes members of a subgroup of a racial identity group in scientific versus humanistic terms. Because of the stereotype it's identity-based negativity and insulting, and additionally it's threatening because such language has been historically used to encourage violence against Black men. There is no profanity present. The stereotyping makes this very toxic and on its own would make me likely to leave the discussion, with the author's clear implications about the motives of certain individuals and organizations only increasing that likelihood.",2,B

Also, I would say that this is toxic but not ""very toxic"" because it is insulting and uses questionable argumentative tactics that can be considered unreasonable, but is not extremely aggressive or hateful. To say a bit more about why the author's argument is toxic, I will nitpick on definitions; ""car[ing] less what race a person ascribes to be"" does not actually mean that one is not racist; it refers to the phenomenon of ""colorblindness"" which some argue is actually a racist position, so the author's deflection of what was presumably a prior accusation comes across as overly defensive without actually giving a helpful reason.

No, it's not correct. Your twisted and lopsided interpretation of Comey's statement is even worse. Did you lift this drivel from FAUX Oooze? Lush Rimbaugh?",1,-1,1,1,-1,0,"There are a few insults here, though most are not directly towards people. ""Twisted and lopsided interpretation"" and ""drivel"" are directed at ideas rather than people, though there is an implication that the author has negative views about the person being quoted. Similarly, the misspelling of ""Fox News"" as ""FAUX Ooze"" is insulting, but towards a TV network, which is a bit ambiguous as well because a TV network is not a person. There is also an insult in the quote directed towards Hillary Clinton, but this is a quote and not the author's sentiment, so again that does not qualify as an insult. However, I did mark this comment as an insult because of the last instance: the author additionally misspells ""Rush Limbaugh"" as ""Lush Rimbaugh"", which is directly mocking a specific person. This, along with the author's general mocking tone, make this toxic, but I would not classify it as very toxic because the mocking is a somewhat rude form of political satire rather than hateful. I'm not sure if I would leave the conversation because I feel similarly to the author, however if this person continued to use inflammatory language I would leave the conversation.
